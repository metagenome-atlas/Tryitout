# Try out Atlas

This repo contains the instruction to setup [Metagenome-Atlas](https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/atlas) with limited resources.

You probably followed the [Tutorial](https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/Tutorial) to arrive here.
Otherwise you can do the [interactive totorial](https://metagenome-atlas.shinyapps.io/TryAtlas). 

## Setup
If you see this in the GitHub Codespaces environment.

You should see a `terminal` in the bottom plane.

➤ Make the terminal it bigger. 

➤ Run the `setup_codespaces.sh` script in the terminal

This repo contains the instruction to setup Metagenome-Atlas with limited resources specified in the profile.
It uses a small test dataset that contain two samples with some small genomes that could be assembled and binned.

The goal is that users can install metagenome-atlas and initialize a new project. Not the whole pipeline can be executed due to the high memory usage and limited resources.  Quality control, assembly, genecatalog and binning (up to CheckM) work.



## Setup

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circleci-docs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/metagenome-atlas/Tryitout)


Run the setup.sh script

## Usage

```
mamba install metagenome-atlas
```
